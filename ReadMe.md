# [Sorting Visualizer](https://pradipsable07.github.io/SortingVisualizer-with-javaScript/)

## Overview

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer, a JavaScript-based web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms. Watch as the algorithms manipulate a set of elements, showcasing the sorting process in real-time. This project utilizes React.js to efficiently manage the user interface, allowing for an interactive and educational experience. Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and more are visualized to enhance understanding.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or start a local server.

## Algorithms Visualized

- **Bubble Sort**: Visual representation of the classic Bubble Sort algorithm.
- **Selection Sort**: Observe the Selection Sort algorithm in action, efficiently sorting the elements.
- **Quick Sort**: Witness the Quick Sort algorithm partitioning and sorting the elements.
- **Heap Sort**: Experience the Heap Sort algorithm building a max heap and sorting the elements.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Algorithms are visually represented, providing a clear understanding of sorting processes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use buttons to initiate sorting algorithms and shuffle the array for a dynamic experience.

- **Efficient Data Manipulation**: The project is designed using JavaScript, ensuring smooth and efficient array manipulation.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a work in progress, and future enhancements may include additional sorting algorithms, improved visualization features, and educational resources. Your feedback and contributions are appreciated!
